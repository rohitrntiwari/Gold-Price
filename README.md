# 🟡 Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

A machine learning project that predicts gold prices using the **Random Forest Regressor** algorithm. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Overview

Gold prices fluctuate due to various economic, geopolitical, and market factors. Accurate prediction of gold prices can be valuable for investors, traders, and analysts. This project applies a **Random Forest Regressor**, a robust ensemble learning method, to forecast gold prices based on historical data.

## 🧾 Dataset

We use a dataset that contains historical gold prices, typically including the following features:

- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

> 🔗 You can download a sample dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or use any time-series gold price dataset in `.csv` format.
